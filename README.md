# SpotifySearcher
A simple React Native app to search artists on Spotify and return their follower count, as well as profile picture.

## Running the app
To run this application, use Expo (https://expo.io/) to quickly run the React Native code on web, Android, or iOS.  
The only other necessary item is for you to provide your own `credentials.json`, which is detailed in the main project file `App.js`.
