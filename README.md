# SpotifySearcher
A simple React Native app to search artists on Spotify and return their follower count, as well as profile picture.

This was created in React Native for its ability to support Android, iOS, and web development using the same feature set - so, this application theoretically both Android and iOS.  However, I was unable to use the network features of Expo to test on a local device, as my apartment's WiFi does not allow for the needed features.  All testing was done in the web app version and it performs as expected there - and I would expect it to perform similarly on a smartphone.

## Running the app
To run this application, use Expo (https://expo.io/) to quickly run the React Native code on web, Android, or iOS.  
The only other necessary item is for you to provide your own `credentials.json`, which is detailed in the main project file `App.js`.
